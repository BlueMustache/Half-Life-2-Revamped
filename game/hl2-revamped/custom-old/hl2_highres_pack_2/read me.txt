These are high quality skins of the HL2 characters that I made for my mod, the
Half-Life 2 Enhancement mod (name subject to change). Released upon request.
The forum thread for the mod can be found here: http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1236615

You are free to use the textures in any of your work, but if you use it in another mod, please give credit to me. 
Do NOT re-upload these to any pay-sites!
Please do not skin my skins without my permission.
Please do not claim my work as your own.

Thank you.
